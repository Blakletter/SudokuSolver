 Sudoku solver/creator
 
This is a multithreaded Sudoku solver/creater. It uses a backtracking algorithm and will send the created puzzles to a server when the results are complete so they can be viewed in your web browser. The server is a Node.js server and simply displays results and supports remote starting of the sudoku creator.
